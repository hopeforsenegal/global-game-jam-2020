# global-game-jam-2020


A 2D Side-scrolling platformer. Using classic Metroidvania mechanics with a unique art style, Robocalypse is a fun yet challenging adventure through the Roaring 20's. The player controls a robot who has lost half of his appendages, and must search to collect them all and regain his full power. The evil Dinosaurus Rex must be defeated, or all will perish. Power up and send him back to extinction!
